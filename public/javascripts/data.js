We also recognise limitations in some categories: for example we don't currently collect data on gender identity e.g non-binary; transgender; or minority sexualities e.g. asexual or queer. We believe that an understanding of intersectionality is essential to building an inclusive culture, so our next step is to analyse combinations of multiple demographics.",
